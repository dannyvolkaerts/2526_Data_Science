# Data Profiling with ydata-profiling

## What is Data Profiling?

Data profiling is the process of examining and analyzing datasets to understand their structure, content, and quality. It provides comprehensive insights into your data by automatically generating statistical summaries, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and highlighting potential data quality issues.

### Why is Data Profiling Important?

Data profiling helps data scientists and analysts to:

- **Understand data structure** - Get an overview of columns, data types, and relationships
- **Identify data quality issues** - Detect missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
- **Discover patterns and distributions** - Understand how data is distributed across variables
- **Find correlations** - Identify relationships between different variables
- **Detect outliers** - Spot unusual values that might need attention
- **Save time** - Quickly understand datasets without writing extensive exploratory code
- **Make informed decisions** - Base data cleaning and preprocessing decisions on comprehensive analysis

## ydata-profiling Tool

https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/

`ydata-profiling` (formerly known as `pandas-profiling`) is a powerful Python library that generates comprehensive data profiling reports from pandas DataFrames with just a single line of code.

### Key Features

- **Automated Analysis** - Generates detailed reports automatically
- **Interactive HTML Reports** - Beautiful, interactive web-based reports
- **Comprehensive Statistics** - Descriptive statistics for all data types
- **Data Quality Assessment** - Identifies missing values, duplicates, and data quality issues
- **Correlation Analysis** - Shows relationships between variables
- **Distribution Visualization** - Histograms, box plots, and other visualizations
- **Configurable** - Customizable analysis parameters
- **Integration Ready** - Works seamlessly with Jupyter notebooks and web applications

## Installation

### Method 1: Using pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install ydata-profiling
```

### Method 2: Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ydata-profiling
```

## Basic Usage

### Simple Profiling Report

```python
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Generate the profiling report
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Data Profiling Report")

# Save as HTML file
profile.to_file("data_profile_report.html")

# Display in Jupyter notebook
profile.to_notebook_iframe()
```

### Quick Example with Sample Data

```python
# Simple example 
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Basic profiling report
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Titanic Analysis")
profile.to_file("titanic_report.html")
print("Report saved as titanic_report.html")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Minimal Reports for Large Datasets

```python
# For datasets > 100MB, start minimal
profile = ProfileReport(df, minimal=True)
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Titles and Metadata

```python
profile = ProfileReport(
    df,
    title="Customer Database - Q3 2023",
    dataset={
        "description": "Quarterly customer analysis",
        "creator": "Analytics Team",
        "copyright_holder": "Company Name",
        "copyright_year": "2023"
    }
)
```

### 3. Save Configuration for Consistency

```python
# Save your preferred configuration
config = {
    "title": "Standard Data Profile",
    "explorative": True,
    "dark_mode": False,
    "correlations": {
        "pearson": {"calculate": True},
        "spearman": {"calculate": True}
    }
}

# Reuse configuration
profile = ProfileReport(df, **config)
```

### 4. Automate Report Generation

```python
def generate_monthly_profile(data_path, output_dir):
    """Generate monthly data profiling reports."""
    import os
    from datetime import datetime
    
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m")
    
    profile = ProfileReport(
        df,
        title=f"Monthly Data Profile - {current_date}",
        explorative=True
    )
    
    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f"profile_{current_date}.html")
    profile.to_file(output_path)
    
    print(f"Profile generated: {output_path}")

# Schedule this function to run monthly
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
   ```python
   # Use minimal mode
   profile = ProfileReport(df, minimal=True)
   ```

2. **Slow Performance**
   ```python
   # Disable expensive computations
   profile = ProfileReport(
       df,
       correlations={"pearson": {"calculate": False}},
       interactions={"targets": []},
       explorative=False
   )
   ```

3. **HTML Report Not Opening**
   ```python
   # Ensure file path is correct and accessible
   import os
   profile.to_file(os.path.abspath("report.html"))
   ```
